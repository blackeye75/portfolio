          I spend most of my time in front of laptop developing and learning.
          Working remotely is that I love, because it saves (a lot of) commuting
          time. However, this does not mean I am unwilling to work in other
          locations.

          I spend most of my time in front of my laptop, either developing or
          expanding my skill set. I'm a big believer in focusing on a specific
          area and mastering it. I love working remotely as it saves valuable
          commuting time, but I'm always open to opportunities that require
          working in different locations.
